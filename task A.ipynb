        "#### 🔵 What?\n",
        "\n",
        "A pared down explanation of rhythm might emphasize:\n",
        "- **duration**: the amount of time a musical event (note, chord, rest) or group of musical events lasts\n",
        "- **onset**: the location in a score or measure at which an event begins, typically measured in terms of beat number\n",
        "- **rest**: the location and balance of moments which do not stimulate the listener (especially in contrast with those that do)\n",
        "\n",
        "The importance of these elements for rhythmic *structure* arises in how they reinforce or disrupt **meter**, or the recurring pattern of musical event timings that drives a musical piece. Meter is specified in part by the time signature, which informs the number of beats per measure, and in part by onsets, durations, and rests, which implicitly assign importance to certain beats on the **metrical grid**:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "![metrical_grid](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=18iGMM9nleNfxG48PixLlLtP0Qa84JzH-)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In short: rhythmic structure is the scaffolding that defines how often and for how long the listener can expect to hear sounds.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 🟡 How?\n",
        "\n",
        "From the symbolic perspective, composers select the sounded and unsounded durations they desire for their music:   \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "![notes_rests](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1pYjeytLogXmT9oh6SN7LAH_EpwWAOd_-)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The standard unit of measurement in rhythmic analysis is the <u>beat</u> or, equivalently, the unpitched note corresponding to one beat in the active time signature (eg in the chart above, which lists a 4/4 time signature in the final column header, the durational unit could be the quarter note).\n",
        "\n",
        "Apart from duration, onset, and rest, there are further symbolic aspects (possibly syncopation) and elements of musical performance (rubato) which, though beyond the scope of this introductory notebook, feed into rhythmic structure. All of these intentional rhythmic elements ultimately interact with the listener to bring life to structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 🟣 Why?\n",
        "\n",
        "We claim rhthmic elements *interact* with the listener because **rhythm exists in the mind.** When we listen to music, we unconsciously learn the timing pattern characteristic to a piece and begin to anticipate musical events based on this learned pattern. This point is not to be missed: to listen to music is to encode all time-based events into a structure that allows us to form expectations. *This* is where rhythmic structure really exists.\n",
        "\n",
        "The great benefit of this process is that musicians can rely it to shape an experience. As listeners come to expect a certain pattern, continued reinforcement feels earned and satisfying while deviations can surprise, delight, or worry. Dance becomes possible. Emotions can be inspired. Stories can be told. What we have is a way to start pulling levers with respect to unconscious human behaviour."

A, B1, and C are rhythmically similar save for a bit of ornamentation (listen again with the block above to confirm). B2 is an entirely different beast. Meanwhile, our analysis is finding the average onset distribution using 16 measures labeled 'B2' **in combination with** 12 measures labeled A, B1, or C, ensuring our analysis 'straddles' a structural change in rhythmic pattern (of course, this so-called structural change it is not as severe as it would be if we were changing score or genre).

We have seen how structural changes in a piece can complicate conclusions about what sort of rhythm characterizes an entire piece. But this has all been exploratory!
